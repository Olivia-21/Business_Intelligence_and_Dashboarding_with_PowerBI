# Student Performance Analysis Dashboard

## 1. Project Overview 
**Objective:** Develop a comprehensive dashboard to track and analyze student performance across **Power BI** and **AWS Cloud** training tracks. The dashboard provides actionable insights into attendance, participation, lab scores, and certification rates for program managers and trainers.

## 2. Data Sources
The dashboard is built from the following raw data inputs:
*   **Zoom Attendance Logs** (CSV): Daily folders for Week 1–10. Contains `Join Time`, `Leave Time`, and `Duration`.
*   **Labs & Quizzes** (Excel): Weekly scores recorded for each student.
*   **Participation Records** (Excel): Logs of students who actively participated in class sessions.
*   **Learner Status** (Excel): Tracks `Graduation Status` (Graduate/Dropout) and `Certification Status`.

## 3. Data Modeling & Transformation
The project utilizes a **Star Schema** architecture for optimal performance:
*   **Dim_Learner**: The central dimension table containing unique student details (Name, Email, Track, Cohort).
*   **Fact_Attendance**: Daily attendance records.
*   **Fact_Grades**: Unpivoted table containing all Lab and Quiz scores.
*   **Fact_Participation**: Daily participation events.
*   **Fact_Status**: Current status of each learner.

**Key Transformations:**
*   **Attendance Filtering**: Implemented logic to strictly define "Attendance" as sessions lasting **> 30 minutes**.
*   **Unpivoting**: Transformed weekly grade columns into a transactional format for analysis.
*   **Text Parsing**: Split grouped participation lists into individual student rows.

## 4. Key Metrics (DAX)
*   **Attendance Rate %**: `(Valid Days Attended / Total Classes)`. *Note: Only counts sessions > 30 mins.*
*   **Participation Rate %**: `(Actual Participation Count / Total Opportunities)`.
*   **Graduation Rate %**: `(Total Graduates / Total Learners)`.
*   **Average Assessment Score**: Combined average of Lab and Quiz scores.

## 5. Dashboard Structure

### Page 1: Overall Performance Metrics
*Target Audience: Stakeholders / Program Directors*
*   **KPI Cards**: Total Learners, Graduates, Dropouts, Certified.
*   **Charts**: Comparison of Graduation, Certification, and Dropout rates by Track.
*   **Filters**: Track, Cohort, Certification Type.

### Page 2: Detailed Learner Insights
*Target Audience: Trainers / Instructors*
*   **Detailed Table**: Row-level view of every student’s performance (Attendance %, Grades, etc.).
*   **Summary Cards**: Average Labs Completed, Total Hours Spent, Average Scores.
*   **Granular Filters**: Month, Week, Learner Status, Program Status.

## 6. How to Use
1.  Open `Student_Attendance_And_Performance_Dashboard.pbix` in Power BI Desktop.
2.  Ensure source files are located in the `Data/` directory if refreshing is required.
3.  Use the **Slicers** on the dashboard (Top/Side panels) to filter by Track or Cohort.
4.  Hover over charts for specific tooltips.
